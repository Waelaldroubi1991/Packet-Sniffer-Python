Hey

this code consiste of 4 main parts:

1) (PacketHeaderBase) class to go through data and get the headers.
2) (process_packet) class to decide the header type
3) class for each type to analysis it and to make it human readable.
4) (main) class to call (process_packet) in an infinite loop to read streams of data.

..................................

how code works:
(PacketHeaderBase) will read the data and find headers, (process_packet) will check the type of the header founded
and will call it then the next header and then next one till the stream of data stop or finished in our case.

this program depends on pcapy python library, it is needed to be installed before running this code.

Note: the code is explained and has notes between its lines.
